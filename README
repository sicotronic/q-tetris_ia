This is a java IA agent that is meant to select actions for the Tetris domain in order to obtain the best score posible. 
This agent learn with the implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm.
I made this agent as the final project of the subject Artificial Intelligence at College.

All the files are the ones provided by the 2009 rl-competition except for the code that I wrote, which is in the file: 
agents/tetrisAgentJava/src/QTetrisAgent.java
this program also created the file: 
agents/tetrisAgentJava/Qvalues.dat  
where I saved the values of the Q-Matrix obtained during the training.
